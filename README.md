# macos-etcd

Macos-etcd is a free desktop etcd client based on gomobile and SwiftUI.


# Notice

due to the following reasons, **the project has been abandoned and is no longer maintained:**

- It does not support cross-platform desktop applications for both Windows and Linux.
- The framework package in gomobile has blocking and deadlock issues that cannot be resolved.
